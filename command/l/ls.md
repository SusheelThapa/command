# `ls`

## Description

`ls` is a standard Unix utility that lists the files in the directory specified in the path. By default it lists the files in the current directory. It is similar to `dir` command in Windows.

It can be modified with flags to further improve its functionality.

The command syntax is:

```shellv
ls [flags] [path to directory]
```

## Flags

Some of the popular flags that are used with `ls` command are as follows:

- [`-a` or `--all`](#a): lists hidden items
- [`-l`](#l): display more information about the items.
- [`-r`](#r): lists the items in reverse order.
- [`-t`](#t): lists the item sorted by time.
- [`--help`](#help): get more information about the command and uncommon flags. 

### `-a`

**Description:**

With the `-a` option, the `ls` command will show hidden files and sub-folders. By defaultfiles and folders beginning with `.` are hidden and they are not listed when doing a typical `ls` command

**Usage:**
Consider we are inside a folder that contains three files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt` and a hidden file `.file.txt`. If we want to see the hidden file we need to use the `-a` flag as:

```shell
ls -a
```

_Output:_

```
.file.txt  file1.txt  file2.txt
```

### `-l`

**Description:**

With the `-l` flag, the `ls` command will list the files in the current directory in a detailed, long-form format.

The long form listing consists of the following columns.

1. **File Type and Permissions**: The leftmost column displays a series of characters that  indicate the file type and its permissions. The first character indicates the file type, with '-' for a regular file, 'd' for a directory, 'l' for a symbolic link, and more. The following nine characters represent the file's permissions, with 'r' for read, 'w' for write, and 'x' for execute. These characters are displayed for the file owner, the group, and others, with three characters for each.

2. **Number of Hard Links**: The second  column shows the number of hard links associated with the file or directory. Hard links are multiple directory entries that point to the same inode on disk.

3. **Owner**: The third column displays the owner of the file or directory.

4. **Group**: The fourth column shows the group associated with the file or directory.

5. **File Size**: The fifth column indicates the size of the file in bytes.

6. **Modification Date and Time**: The next columns display the date and time when the file was last modified.

7. **File/Directory Name**: The final column shows the name of the file or directory.

**Usage:**
Taking the example from above we can enter the following into the terminal
```shell
ls -l
```

_Output:_

```shell
-rw-r--r-- 1 username groupname 1024 Nov  5 12:40 file1.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 username groupname 1024 Nov  5 12:40 file2.txt
```

Let's interpret the first line of output to better understand the flag.

* `-rw-r--r--`: This represents the file permissions and file type. It indicates that file1.txt is a regular file (- indicates a regular file, d would indicate a directory). The rw-r--r-- part represents the permissions for the file (read, write for the owner, read for the group, and read for others).

* `1`: This shows the number of hard links to the file or directory. In this case, it's 1.

* `username`: This is the owner of the file.

* `groupname`: This is the group associated with the file.

* `1024`: This is the file size in bytes.

* `Nov 5 12:40`: These are the date and time of last modification.

* `file1.txt`: This is the name of the file.

### `-r`

**Description:**

With the `-a` option, the `ls` command will show files and sub-folders sorted in reverse alphanumeric order.

**Usage:**
Taking the example from above we can enter the following into the terminal

```shell
ls -r
```

_Output:_

```
file2.txt  file1.txt
```

### `-t`

**Description:**

With the `-t` option, the `ls` command will show files and sub-folders sorted by time.

**Usage:**
Taking the example from above we can enter the following into the terminal

```shell
ls -t
```

_Output:_

```
file2.txt  file1.txt
```

### `--help`

**Description:**

With the `--help` option, the `ls` command will show other flags and options for the command that are not commonly used.

**Usage:**

```shell
ls --help
```

## Examples

1. When you want to long list all files (Including Hidden Files) in your home directory:

   ```shell
   ls -la ~ or ls -l -a ~
   ```

2. If you want to know what the items are contained in the /etc folder of the filesystem:

   ```shell
   ls /etc or ls [path_to_etc]
   ```

3. If you want to sort the content in your home directory to see which was added most recently:
    ```shell
    ls -t ~
    ```

4. If you want to look at the items in a folder in reverse alphabetical order:
    ```shell
    ls -r [path_to_folder]
    ```

## Additional Information

As seen in example 1, the flags can be combined. This is common for all commands in linux that do not take a parameter after the flag.  Hence the `-l` and `-a` flag can be combined to `-la` flag.

## Exercises

1. Use the `--help` flag and find the flag to    recursively list the items in a folder.

2. Navigate to the `/usr/bin` directory and find out the tools installed in your system.

3. Find the number of pictures in your system. Hint: `wc` command prints the number of newline, words and bytes for each file.

4. Navigate to your `Downloads` folder and find out what was your first download.

5. Reverse list the items in your `home` directory.
